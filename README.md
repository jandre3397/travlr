# README: Full Stack Development Reflection  

In my full stack project, I used both Express HTML/JavaScript and an Angular single-page application (SPA). While Express handled basic server-side rendering, Angular provided a smoother, more interactive experience by reducing page reloads and improving state management.  

For the backend, I used MongoDB, a NoSQL database that offers flexibility in handling dynamic travel-related data. Unlike relational databases, MongoDBâ€™s schema-less structure made it easier to scale and modify as new features were added.  

JSON played a key role in connecting the frontend and backend, allowing structured data exchange between Angular and Express/MongoDB. Unlike JavaScript, which is a programming language, JSON is a lightweight data format that simplifies API communication.  

To improve efficiency, I refactored API requests and implemented reusable UI components, such as trip cards and booking forms. This reduced redundant code and made the application more maintainable.  

I conducted API testing for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests, ensuring proper data retrieval and security. Implementing JWT authentication added a layer of protection, requiring additional testing to verify access control and prevent unauthorized modifications.  

This project strengthened my skills in full stack development, particularly in building scalable and secure applications. I gained hands-on experience with Angular, Express, and MongoDB, improving my ability to develop interactive web applications.  

As I pursue a career in software engineering, these skills in frontend/backend integration, API design, and efficient coding practices will be invaluable. This experience has boosted my confidence in developing real-world applications and problem-solving in a full stack environment.
